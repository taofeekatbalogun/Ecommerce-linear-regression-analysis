# Ecommerce Customer Spending Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior data for an ecommerce company offering both in-store styling sessions and online purchases.  
The goal was to determine whether the company should prioritize its *mobile app* or *website* to drive revenue growth.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Linear Regression
- Power BI (for business-focused visualization)

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer engagement metrics such as:
- Avg. Session Length
- Time on App
- Time on Website
- Length of Membership
- Yearly Amount Spent

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Linear Regression modeling
3. Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, RMSE)
4. Business insight translation using Power BI

## Key Insights
- Time spent on the *mobile app* has a strong positive impact on yearly spending.
- Time spent on the *website* has minimal influence on revenue.
- Length of membership is the strongest predictor of customer value.

## Business Recommendations
- Prioritize mobile app optimization
- Focus on customer retention strategies
- Target high-engagement, low-spend users for upsell opportunities

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook (modeling & analysis)
- Power BI Dashboard (business insights)
